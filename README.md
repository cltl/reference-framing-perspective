## Call for Papers

When something happens in the world, we have access to an unlimited range of ways (from lexical choices to specific syntactic structures) to refer to the same real-world event. We can chose to express information explicitly or imply it. Variations in reference may convey radically different perspectives. This process of making reference to something by adopting a specific perspective is also known as framing. Although previous work in this area is present (see Ali and Hassan (2022)’s survey for an overview), there is a lack of a unitary framework and only few targeted datasets (Chen et al., 2019) and tools based on Large Language Models exist (Minnema et al., 2022). In this workshop, we propose to adopt Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1968, 1985, 2006)  as a unifying theoretical framework and analysis method to understand the choices made in linguistic references to events. The semantic frames (expressed by predicates and roles) we choose give rise to our understanding, or framing, of an event. We aim to bring together different research communities interested in lexical and syntactic variation, referential grounding, frame semantics, and perspectives. We believe that there is significant overlap within the goals and interests of these communities, but not necessarily the common ground to enable collaborative work.

### Referentially Grounded Shared Dataset

One way to study variation in framing is to conduct contrastive analyses of texts reporting on the same real-world event. Such an analysis can help to reveal the extent of variation in framing and possibly give rise to the underlying factors that lead to different choices in framing the same event. We collected such a corpus about the Eurovision Song Festival and make it available as a Shared Dataset for the Workshop. The purpose of this corpus is to enable exploratory analyses, facilitate discussion among participants, and, last but not least, make our workshop a real working workshop.

The corpus is composed of news articles reporting on the Eurovision Song Contest that took place in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (canceled in 2020 and held in 2021). The news articles have been collected using the structured data-to-text approach (Vossen et al., 2018). The corpus contains news articles in multiple languages. We invite participants to submit short and targeted analyses using the data (extended abstracts to be discussed in a hands-on data session). Participants are also free to use the data in regular contributions.

### Regular Contributions

Regular contributions: We aim to lay the groundwork for such efforts. We invite contributions (regular long papers of 8 pages or short papers of 4 pages) targeting any of the following - non-exhaustive - list of topics:

* Theoretical models of framing and perspective
* Annotation frameworks for framing and perspectives
* Computational models of framing and perspective
* Approaches for creating and analyzing referentially grounded datasets (containing different perspectives, written at different points in time, written in different languages)
* Approaches for and analyses of texts about contested and divisive events triggering different opinions and perspectives
* Analyses of and methods for analyzing (diachronic) lexical variation and framing
* Language resources for reference, frames, and perspectives
* Approaches and tools to compare claims of sources
* Frames as expressions of bias in the representation of social groups
* User interface for the visualization of multiple perspectives

COLING-LREC policy for submissions:

When submitting a paper from the START page, authors will be asked to provide essential information about resources (in a broad sense, i.e. also technologies, standards, evaluation kits, etc.) that have been used for the work described in the paper or are a new result of your research. Moreover, ELRA encourages all LREC-COLING authors to share the described LRs (data, tools, services, etc.) to enable their reuse and replicability of experiments (including evaluation ones).

### Extended Abstracts

We invite extended abstracts (1,500 words maximum) about small analyses or experiments conducted on our Shared Data. The abstracts will be non-archival and discussed in a dedicated data session.
